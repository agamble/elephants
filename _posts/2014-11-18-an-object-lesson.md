Artistic pieces exist in three forms: those with purpose, those without, and those with purpose unconsidered. The latter of these results entirely unsatisfactory pieces, while the prior two will consistently deliver better.

I write this now prompted by a play I saw in Edinburgh Fringe: The Object Lesson. You enter a room filled with cardboard boxes and miscellaneous trinkets. There are stacks of boxes around the room and the lights are already dimmed and you are prompted by small notes to dismantle the box piles and use them as seating. The audience orders themselves and as seats are taken, we are to realise the play has already begun - there is a man rearranging the furniture of the room.

The play has no plot, instead we watch this man uncover and discuss the objects he finds within the boxes. We discover the items are tangential items from the man's past and watch the script introduce occasional intersections between them. There is no logical conclusion to this play, none of the events described resolve themselves in the second half. Often also, the play presents several contradictory ideas: "regret is inevitable" vs. "regret is solely an autonomous result". It's slick and charming and works well.

I describe this play in the second category of the three ideas listed above: it is purposefully purposeless. There isn't a clear message given to the audience, there isn't a reason for this work to exist. It just provides 90 minutes of entertainment.

So what's the point? Media made in this way, I believe, should be looked at no further than the merits of its face value. This should be used to distinguish whether its purpose has been successfully omitted, or whether the motivation lies unconsidered or unsuccessfully attempted. It's "art for art's sake", there's nothing to take away other than what is given to the audience - just the idle pleasures of its performance.

I've found this in other mediums as well: music which is great in its charming uselessness. I love The Beatles for this quality. A good subset of their songs contain surprising complexity and yet leave no lingering thoughts of their content. A Hard Day's Night, Eight Days a Week and Help! are great examples, but there are about 40 others which would serve just as well. They are meant to appeal through the music itself, rather than the message contained within the lyrics.

In art it's also pretty easy to find. Jack Vettriano isn't highly thought of among art critics, but his paintings are incredibly popular. The Singing Butler is his most famous and I mostly agree with the sentiment that his work is mostly just "mindless eroticism". The paintings offer nothing to the viewer beyond an aesthetic pleasure and shallow mystique. However, I don't agree with using this as a reason for casting value aside.

Popularity itself should be a sufficient condition for placing value in a piece of art. How can the singular views of people judging against an imaginary set of objective standards be worth more than the wider acclaim the painting receives from its viewers? Art can be created for its audience and its audience can judge merit.
 I don't like the criticism that an artistic piece is vapid, in part for this reason. Differentiating between purpose unconsidered and absent is not always possible - sometimes a single piece can have aspects belonging to both sets.

So while it's easy to dismiss the most populist media for being without purpose, its popularity should be something to revere and spark curiosity. Doing this yields us art which has succeeded in its goal to appeal to its audience. Of course though, the patterns of repetition in popular media that emerge to you in month to month trends may still become tiring and boring. We have never seen art stand still, reprise cannot last indefinitely and will eventually be replaced with novelty.

So the truth of what I am arguing is much more simple. That in fact, this trend of purposeless art is a conscious choice made by the artist. That I see no difference between the plot An Object Lesson and the vacuous lyrics of Kanye - it's all just words. That placing value in art for what it gives us under scrutiny can be worthwhile, but is not more worthwhile than what it gives us without further analysis.
