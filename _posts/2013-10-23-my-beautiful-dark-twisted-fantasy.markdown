The album’s strength lies in being intensely personal, while constantly maintaining a sense of the grand. The first song, Dark Fantasy, presents a common theme for the album: juxtaposing imposing chorus motifs against traditional hip-hop. Truly great albums all have some abstract common thread running between songs: baroque melancholy in Arcade Fire’s Funeral; polychromatism in Radiohead’s In Rainbows; and cavernous gospel in U2’s The Joshua Tree. While this remains true throughout MBDTF, the album's scope to explore is vast. POWER and All of the Lights are anthems, while Runaway and Gorgeous are intimate.

I listen to this album in the context of when it was released. Delivery in the midst of being universally despised for sake of ego and mindlessness, makes this venture all the more impressive. The album is never apologetic for its brazen style, nor does it shy away from opportunities to create visceral imagery. It realises Kanye West as a mature musician who fully understands and nourishes the persona his music embodies.

A vast array of other artists feature on this record, and the way that they and their unique styles are blended masterfully together is unlike any other release. Samples from Bon Iver’s Woods in Lost in the World, Gil Scott-Heron’s read-aloud poetry are exciting because they are so different.

My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is bold and raw, two of the qualities among many to make it a modern masterpiece.
