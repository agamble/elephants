Love is something like reaching the peak of a tall mountain surrounded by clouds. The farther you and your partner climb, the less you will be able to see around you. When asked about you, your friends will simply point up at the clouds and say, “he’s up there.” You might leave your partner without having reached the top of the mountain, or your partner might leave you. In either case, you didn’t quite attain love, but you probably made it farther than most have.

There will come a point, once you are very near the peak, when you and your partner will be unable to see even each other. The clouds will still envelop you, and you will still feel as if you are in love, but the object of your love will be lost. You and your partner might make an effort to find each other in the clouds, and if you were clever enough to hold hands on the way up you might never have lost each other to begin with. Unfortunately, few of us have the fortitude to spend very long alone at the top of the mountain, for the clouds are cold and the air is thin.

Having given up, you will leave the peak. The farther you descend, the more you will be able to see around you. Depending on how long you spent at the peak, things at the bottom will look different. You might have only climbed the mountain as a day trip and returned to the bottom to find everything exactly as you left it. Or maybe you spent years at the top and returned to find everything in disarray. When looking back at the peak, you might long to return or wonder what it was like to be up there. Some of us will climb the mountain many times, others will go up only once. Each time must be different.
