I am writing this short essay in response to what I believe is the misuse and abuse of minimalism in design today. Good designers recognize minimalism as the effort to expose the essence of a subject by concentrating the essential and eliminating the unnecessary. The sweeping success of products strongly influenced by minimalism, including most recently the iPhone, has lead (ironically) to an overextension and perversion of minimalist concepts in design. In this essay I outline why, despite what many designers think, less is not always more, and propose that rather than scrapping minimalism or allowing it to self-destruct as a consequence of its own success, we should view minimalism through the lens of a different ism: authenticism. While authenticism might seem like a redesign of minimalism, I like to think of it as a return to minimalism’s origins.

Good design is authentic. A design is authentic when it accurately captures the essence of a product’s function. Some of the best examples of authentic design can be seen at Dyson. Dyson vacuums are marketed as functional solutions to obvious problems.

The design of the Dyson DC25 embodies its functional character. In addition to using color to denote important components (like on/off switches), the designers at Dyson extend the use of color to highlight the parts considered to be most innovative. The cones that handle Dyson’s powerful cyclone technology and the ball Dyson thought up to replace traditional wheels are both colored bright orange. The bin that holds the collected dust is transparent not only so the user can measure whether the vacuum should be emptied (a simple strip of transparency would suffice for that) but also to emphasize another one of Dyson’s innovations: elimination of the bag.

Consider two other vacuums, both of which have been designed badly and lack authenticity. The red Eureka vacuum doesn’t feature any of the innovations that Dyson vacuums do, but does that mean it lacks a central character? The product is still a vacuum and therefore still has a function, but its design does nothing to capture that function. The DC25 shows off its internal components and central function through color and shape. As a user I can gain a basic understanding of how the DC25 functions just by looking at it. The Eureka hides its function behind deceptive branding (the vacuum is labelled “THEBOSS Smartvac”) and opaque red plastic casing.

Color doesn’t always have to be used to emphasize a central function; it can just be decorative or playful. But this use of color only works well when the product itself is decorative or playful. The newly redesigned iPod Touch comes in five different colors, and like on the Eureka the colors themselves do absolutely nothing to promote the device’s central function. Unlike on the Eureka however, the colors on the new iPod Touch are welcome, but only because they are featured on a product which has a playful nature itself. The red of the Eureka makes very little sense. Vacuum cleaners (excluding the Dirt Devil Kone) are not engineered to be decorative or playful.

The last of the three vacuums is from the firm IDEA International. Although the IDEA vacuum isn’t over-embellished like the Eureka, it does have an equally poor design. The central function of the IDEA hides behind a dull cylindrical body that could belong to countless different products. The character of the product is lost in the designer’s attempt to make the vacuum seem neutral. The IDEA was borne out of the success of minimalism but actually works to pervert minimalism. Its designers eliminated the unnecessary and then went on to eliminate everything else.

People interested in design can easily point out why the Eureka is poorly designed, but it is much more difficult to understand why the IDEA is equally bad. The key to evaluating these designs and creating great new designs is authenticism. The success of minimalism as an approach to design means we are seeing much less of products like the Eureka, but unless we evaluate designs for their authenticity, we will replace one nuisance with another and end up with products like the IDEA.
